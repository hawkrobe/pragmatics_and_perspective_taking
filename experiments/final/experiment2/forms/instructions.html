	<h2><center>Guess My Object!</center>  </h2>

	<p>
	  In this experiment you will play a fun communication game
	  with another turker! One of you will be assigned the <b>Speaker</b> role and
	  the other will be the <b>Listener</b>. On each round of the game, we
	  will randomly pick a few simple objects like these:
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  <center>
	    <img src="images/all_objs.png" alt="Example objects"
		 style="width:300px; height:300px">
	  </center>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  and place them in a grid of cubby-holes between
	  you. Although you will just see a 2D view in the game, you
	  can imagine you are sitting across the table from your
	  partner:
	</p>

	<p>
	  <center>
	    <img src="images/3d_grid.png" alt="3D grid of objects"
		 style="width:300px; height:300px">
	  </center>
	</p>

	<p>
	  One of the objects in the grid is the <b>target</b>, which is
	  outlined in orange. Only the Speaker can see which object is
	  the target: 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  <center>
	    <img src="images/targetScreen.png" alt="Example of target"
		 style="width:300px; height:300px">
	  </center>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  The goal of the Speaker is to send a message so that the
	  Listener can figure out which object is the target. You'll
	  both get <b> a bonus of $0.01 for each correct response</b>,
	  so pay attention!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  The goal of the Listener is to identify the target based on
	  the message sent by the Speaker. If you are the Listener,
	  you will first need to wait until the Speaker has sent their
	  message before being able to click on the object you think
	  they're telling you about or replying through the chatbox.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Once the Listener clicks on the object they believe is the
	  target, both players will be given feedback: the Speaker
	  will see what the Listener clicked, and the Listener will
	  see the true target. Then you will both automatically
	  advance to the next round of objects. There are a total
	  of <b>24 rounds</b>. After the final round you will answer a
	  few more questions and be on your way.
	</p>

	<h3> Hidden objects </h3>
	
	<p>
	  What makes this game more interesting is that on some rounds, 
	  <b>curtains</b> will appear in some cells. These curtains
	  block the view of the Speaker, who cannot know what object,
	  if any, is behind the curtain. To illustrate, here is the
	  Speaker's view and Listener's view of the same grid, side by
	  side. The Listener can see that there is a green, checkered
	  circle on their side of the curtain, but the Speaker does
	  not know it is there.
	</p>
	
	<p>

	    <img src="images/speaker_view.png" alt="speaker view" style="width:600px;height:305px">
	    <hr>
	    <img src="images/listener_view.png" alt="listener view" style="width:600px;height:305px">
	  </center>
	</p>
	
	<p> A few final notes: First, since you are playing with
	  another player, you may see this screen before the game
	  begins:
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  <center><img src="images/waitScreen.png" alt="wait screen"
		       style="width:700px;height:150px">
	  </center>
	</p>

	<p>
	  Just hold tight. Another player should join the game within
	  the next few minutes. If you're in the waiting room 15 minutes
	  without another player joining, please return the HIT and try again later!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  Second, please be respectful of the worker you're playing
	  with: pay close attention and try to be as responsive as
	  possible. During each round, please talk only about the game
	  and please use <b>properties of the object</b> instead of
	  simply describing locations in the grid. We will be
	  recording the messages you send for research purposes.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  Finally, please DO NOT refresh the page at any point once
	  you start the game (including the waiting page). If you
	  refresh, you will not be able to rejoin the game you were in
	  and you may not be able to submit the HIT. <br> Thank you!
	</p>

	The <b>listener</b> wants to click on the object that the speaker is

	The speaker should describe the locations of objects in the grid (e.g. "upper-left corner").

	<input type="radio" name="comp" value="yes"> False

	<br>
	If a square in the grid has a curtain, it means

	<input type="radio" name="location" value="no"> The <strong> Listener cannot </strong> see the object behind it.
	<br>
	<input type="radio" name="location" value="yes"> The <strong> Speaker cannot </strong> see the object behind it.
